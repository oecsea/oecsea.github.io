	</li>
	<li>describe, sort, classify, build, and compare two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional figures, and describe the location and movement of objects through investigation
	<ol>
		<li>explore, sort, and compare the attributes (e.g., reflective symmetry) and the properties (e.g., number of faces) of traditional and non-traditional two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional figures (e.g., when sorting and comparing a variety of triangles: notice similarities in number of sides, differences in side lengths, sizes of angles, sizes of the triangles themselves; see smaller triangles in a larger triangle)</li>
		<li>communicate an understanding of basic spatial relationships (e.g., use terms such as &ldquo;above/below&rdquo;, &ldquo;in/out&rdquo;, &ldquo;forward/backward&rdquo;; use visualization, perspective, and movements [flips/reflections, slides/translations, and turns/rotations]) in their conversations and play, in their predictions and visualizations, and during transitions and routines</li>

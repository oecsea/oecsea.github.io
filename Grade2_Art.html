	<ol>
		<li>Creating and Presenting
		<ol>
			<li>develop short movement phrases inspired by a variety of activities in their community(e.g., riding a bike; movements from sports, yoga,or playground games/activities)and incorporating different pathways (e.g., straight, curvy), directions(e.g., forward, back, sideways, diagonal), and shapes (e.g., big/small shapes, shapes created individually and with partners)</li>
			<li>use dance as a language to represent the main ideas in poems and stories, with a focus on body and space (e.g., use arm movements to suggest a cheering crowd; use a circle pathway to suggest the relationship among several characters;use a smooth and delicate sequence of expanding movements to suggest a butterfly emerging from a cocoon)</li>

	<li>DANCE
	<ol>
		<li>Creating and Presenting
		<ol>
			<li>use movements that are part of their daily experience in a variety of ways in dance phrases (e.g., alter and exaggerate movements based on even rhythms such as walking, galloping, and swimming, and on uneven rhythms such as skipping and jumping; amplify and modify percussive movements such as the movement of a clock ticking or the sustained hold of a cat stretching)</li>
			<li>use dance as a language to express feelings and ideas suggested by songs, stories, and poems, with a focus on the element of body, particularly body shapes (e.g., use the entire body [crouch, slump] and body parts [folded arms, bowed head] to express an idea such as deep thought)</li>
			<li>create dance phrases using a variety of ways to connect movements (e.g., connect a melt and a spin using a non-locomotor movement; connect a walk and a skip [locomotor movements] with a circle [pathway])</li>
			<li>use varied and/or contrasting body shapes to communicate different types of messages (e.g., a high level and open, expansive shape to show dominance; a closed huddled shape to show that you are holding a treasured or secret object) Teacher prompt: &ldquo;What body shapes can you use to show you like something? Dislike something? Are there other body shapes to express the same ideas?&rdquo;</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Reflecting, Responding, and Analysing
		<ol>
			<li>describe differences they observe when various movements from daily life are used as the basis or stimulus for movements in a dance phrase (e.g., describe ways in which every- day actions and movements such as skipping on the playground, walking to school, brushing their teeth, or getting dressed are changed when they are used in a dance phrase)</li>
			<li>identify and describe how the element of body is used in contrasting ways to communicate ideas in their own and others&rsquo; dance phrases, with teacher support (e.g., standing versus kneeling body bases can communicate differences in power; curved versus straight shapes can communicate contrasting emotions)</li>
			<li>identify and give examples of their strengths and areas for growth as dance creators and audience members (e.g., using connecting movements; working collaboratively in groups to create dance phrases incorporating everyone&rsquo;s ideas; watching peer performances attentively and asking relevant questions)</li>

		</li>
		<li>Exploring Forms and Cultural Contexts
		<ol>
			<li>describe, with teacher guidance, a variety of dances from different communities around the&nbsp; world that they have seen in the media, at live performances and social gatherings, or in the&nbsp; classroom (e.g., describe traditional dances they have seen to a partner [Chinese ribbon dance,&nbsp; Highland fling, powwow dance styles])</li>
			<li>identify and describe dance experiences in their own lives and communities (e.g., At home:&nbsp; dancing or moving to a favourite song/story; seeing dance on television or in a movie DVD; At school:&nbsp; playing at recess; In the community: dancing or observing dances at weddings, parties, cultural celebrations)</li>

			<li>plan and shape dramatic play by building on the ideas of others, both in and out of role (e.g., In role: add ideas to the dramatic play that reflect the knowledge and experience of the role that is being played [such as a scientist mentioning an experiment or a journalist mentioning an interview]; create and share scenes from their own experiences; Out of role: work in a group to plan and prepare a scene and ask follow-up questions such as &ldquo;How could we make this clearer?

	<li>Heritage and Identity: Our Changing Roles and Responsibilities
	<ol>
		<li>Application: Why Traditions change
		<ol>
			<li>compare ways in which some traditions have been celebrated over multiple generations in their family, and identify some of the main reasons for changes in these traditions (e.g.,&nbsp; immigration to Canada, family members marrying someone from a different culture, changes in technology)</li>
			<li>compare their family&rsquo;s structure and some of their traditions and celebrations with those of their peers&rsquo; families (e.g., traditions/celebrations related to rites of passage, holidays, foods)</li>
			<li>compare some of the past and present traditions and celebrations of different ethno-cultural groups in their local community, and identify some of the main reasons for the change (e.g., influenced by practices around Christmas, some Jewish families now give presents at Hanukkah; when some of their spiritual or cultural traditions were outlawed, First Nations people developed&nbsp; different practices, but now some traditional practices are returning)</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Inquiry: Past and Present Traditions
		<ol>
			<li>formulate questions to guide investigations into some of the past and present traditions&nbsp; and celebrations in their own family and the communities to which they belong (e.g., simple questions related to past and present practices associated with Christmas, Yom Kippur, Eid ul-Fitr, Diwali, or Kwanzaa)</li>
			<li>gather and organize information on some of the past and present traditions and celebrations within their family and the community to which they belong, using primary and/or&nbsp; secondary sources that they have gathered themselves or that have been provided to them (e.g., photo albums, family stories, interviews,&nbsp; artefacts, newspaper clippings, paintings, Elders&rsquo; stories)</li>
			<li>analyse and construct simple maps as part of their investigations into past and present traditions and celebrations in their local community (e.g., locate on a map the regions of&nbsp; origin of different settlers in their area; construct a map that includes an appropriate legend to show different peoples who settled in the area)</li>
			<li>Interpret and analyse information relevant to their investigations, using a variety of tools (e.g., list the holiday decorations that their family uses today and that were used by their grandparents and great-grandparents, and use a Venn diagram to help them determine the similarities and differences; create a list of holiday traditions of their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, and use a bar graph to help them determine which have changed</li>
			<li>evaluate evidence and draw conclusions about past and present traditions and celebrations&nbsp; in their own families and the communities to which they belong</li>
			<li>Communicate the results of their inquiries, using appropriate vocabulary (e.g., holiday, tradition, culture, celebrations, generations) and formats (e.g., a big book cooperatively produced by the class using photographs uploaded from digital cameras; a recording of stories about how celebrations have changed and stayed the same in their family; interpretive movements representing a variety of celebrations)</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Understanding Context: Tradition and Heritage
		<ol>
			<li>identify and describe different types offamilies (e.g., families with one parent, two parents, no children; same-sex families; blended and multi-generational families; immigrant families; families where the parents come from different religious or ethnocultural groups)</li>
			<li>identify some different groups in their com-munity (e.g., various religious and ethnocultural groups), and describe some of the ways in which they contribute to diversity in Canada (e.g., different languages, foods, music, clothing, holidays; ethnic neighbourhoods with specialized shops and restaurants)</li>
			<li>identify countries of personal or familial significance, and locate them on a globe and/or print, digital, or interactive map</li>
			<li>describe some significant traditions and celebrations of their families, their peers, and their own communities, as well as of some other communities in Canada (e.g., fall fairs; faith holidays such as Easter, Passover, Eid ul-Fitr; special days such as Remembrance Day, Canada Day, National Aboriginal Day, Kwanzaa, Earth Day; religious ceremonies; ethnocultural festivals)</li>
			<li>demonstrate an understanding of simple chronology by identifying and organizing chronologically some important events and people from multiple generations in their family and/or community (e.g., construct a three-generation family tree; construct a timeline showing marriages and births within their family; prepare a chronological list showing when family members moved, including, if applicable, when they immigrated to Canada)</li>
			<li>identify some ways in which heritage is passed on through various community celebrations and events (e.g., recipes are passed down to new generations when traditional food is prepared for a community celebration; ethnocultural festivals often showcase traditional costumes, music, dance, stories, and/or games)</li>
			<li>identify some ways in which heritage is passed on through various family celebrations and practices (e.g., celebrations around Christmas, Eid ul-Fitr, Hanukkah, Diwali, Kwanzaa; traditions related to rites of passage)</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>People and Environments: Global Communities
	<ol>
		<li>Application: Interrelationships within the Community
		<ol>
			<li>compare selected communities from around the world, including their own community, in terms of the lifestyles of people in those communities and some ways in which the people meet their needs (e.g., in northern Europe, people have homes that are heated and insulated, while in the Caribbean, houses do not need to be insulated and may have rooms that are open to the outdoors; in cities, most people buy their groceries from a local shop or a grocery store, but in rural South America people either grow their own food&nbsp; or trade with other farmers)</li>
			<li>Describe some of the ways in which two or more distinct communities have adapted to their location, climate, and physical features (e.g., in Arctic Canada, where it is cold, people wear warm clothes made with fur and hide or insulated with down or fleece; in Hawaii some schools start early in the morning and end before it gets really&nbsp; hot in the afternoon)</li>
			<li>demonstrate an understanding of the importance of sustainability in people&rsquo;s&nbsp; interrelationship with their natural environment and of some of the consequences of sustainable and/or non-sustainable actions (e.g., if people&nbsp; in dry regions do not use their water carefully, they may run out; if people do not use sustainable farming techniques, they may exhaust the fertility of the soil; responsible use of resources helps ensure that they will be available for future generations)</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Inquiry: Natural Environments and Way of Life
		<ol>
			<li>Formulate questions to guide investigations into some aspects of the interrelationship between the natural environment of selected communities and the ways in which people&nbsp; live (e.g., questions about how climate relates to clothing, agriculture, housing, recreation)</li>
			<li>gather and organize information and data about some communities&rsquo; locations, climate, and physical features, and the ways of life of people in these communities (e.g., use atlases, globes, print, digital or interactive maps, and/or&nbsp; satellite images to determine location; find photographs in magazines or on the Internet that provide information on people&rsquo;s food, shelter,&nbsp; and/or clothing)</li>
			<li>analyse and construct simple maps to determine and illustrate patterns in the interrelationship between the location of some communities and human activities in those communities (e.g., use a print, digital, or interactive map to determine the proximity of communities to the equator and then infer whether their climates are likely to be hot, temperate, or cold; use different colours on a map to illustrate climatic changes as one moves north and south from the equator; include photographs of shelter, clothing, or recreational activities on a map to show how people&rsquo;s adaptations are related to the general location of their community on the globe)</li>
			<li>interpret and analyse information relevant to their investigations, using a variety of tools (e.g., plot data on a chart, bar graph, or pictograph to help them determine which countries have similar climates; determine the climatic region in which people live by examining photos of their clothing or homes)</li>
			<li>evaluate evidence and draw conclusions about some aspects of the interrelationship between communities&rsquo; natural environment and the ways of life of people in those communities</li>
			<li>communicate the results of their inquiries, using appropriate vocabulary (e.g., globe, sphere, hemisphere, continent, country, equator, North Pole, South Pole, model, distance, culture) and formats (e.g., a book of captioned photos from a field study; song lyrics, a rap, or poem on the way of life in different communities around the world; a poster showing clothing of people who live in cold climates and in hot climates; a role play to illustrate variations in recreational activities)</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Understanding Context: Physical Features and Communities
		<ol>
			<li>demonstrate an understanding that there are a variety of countries, continents, physical features, and bodies of water around the world and that their locations can be represented in different ways (e.g., using globes; print, digital, and/or interactive maps; mapping programs; electronic images)</li>
			<li>identify continents, significant bodies of water, the equator, poles, and hemispheres, using a globe, print, digital, or interactive maps, and/or a mapping program</li>
			<li>identify cardinal directions on a map(i.e., N, S, E, W), and use these directions when locating selected communities, countries, and/or continents</li>
			<li>identify the location of selected countries, cities, and/or towns around the world, and&nbsp; describe how their location and climate are&nbsp; related (e.g., Mexico is warm year-round because it is close to the equator; Canada has four seasons because it is far from the equator; Winnipeg is&nbsp; usually colder than Toronto in the winter because it is farther north</li>
			<li>demonstrate the ability to extract information on the location and climate of a region from photographs and print, digital, and/or interactive maps</li>
			<li>identify basic human needs (e.g., for food, water, clothing, transportation, shelter), and describe some ways in which people in communities around the world meet these needs (e.g., food: hunting, fishing, farming, shopping at grocery stores; transportation: on foot, using animals, using motorized vehicles,&nbsp; by water)</li>
			<li>describe selected communities around the world, with reference to their major physical features, wildlife, and some aspects of their culture (e.g., physical features such as mountains, lakes, rivers; native animals; cultural practices related to food, clothing, recreation, the arts)</li>
			<li>describe similarities and differences between their community and a community in a different region in the world (e.g., with respect to food, clothing, housing, beliefs, climate, flora and fauna, recreation, agricultural practices)</li>

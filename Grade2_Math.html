			<li>demonstrate an understanding of data dis-played in a graph (e.g., by telling a story,by drawing a picture), by comparing dif-ferent parts of the data and by making statements about the data as a whole (e.g.,&ldquo;I looked at the graph that shows how many students were absent each month.More students were away in January than in September.&rdquo;).</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Probability
		<ol>
			<li>describe probability as a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, using mathematical language (i.e.,impossible,unlikely,less likely,equally likely,more likely,certain) (e.g.,&ldquo;If I take a new shoe out of a box without looking, it&rsquo;s equally likely that I will pick the left shoe or the right shoe.&rdquo;);</li>
			<li>describe the probability that an event will occur (e.g., getting heads when tossing a coin, landing on red when spinning a spinner), through investigation with sim-ple games and probability experiments and using mathematical language (e.g.,&ldquo;I tossed 2 coins at the same time, to see how often I would get 2 heads. I found that getting a head and a tail was more likely than getting 2 heads.&rdquo;) (Sample problem:Describe the probability of spin-ning red when you spin a spinner that has one half shaded yellow, one fourth shaded blue, and one fourth shaded red. Experi-ment with the spinner to see if the results are what you expected.).</li>
